This project was created based on the instructions from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/tooltip-ui)

The reference used in this project is also inspired by [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_tooltip.asp)

It's a simple UI that shows how to see a tooltip overhead while adding an a triangle that points to the word for extra showcasing.
